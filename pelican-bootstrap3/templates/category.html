These notebooks contain notes from projects that I have been working on.
Some may be password protected because I did not get permission to share
the information with the world (yet). I use it to share commands that I
ran on particular projects that might be useful to others and for myself as
a log book. Most things here will be unreadable unless you were involved in
the project, but drop me a note if you see something in one of the notes
that be useful to you on either <a
    href="http://twitter.com/inodb">twitter</a> or on mail at x at y dot pm
where x equals y and y equals ino.

{% if category == "blog" %}
This blog contains random ramblings mostly related to bioinformatics and is
intended for a non-coprophagous audience. As one can see from the small
number of posts this part of the website is still under construction.
